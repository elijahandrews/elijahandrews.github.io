![Here I am!](/assets/me_small.png)

Hello! I was born in Toronto, ON. I'm currently studying computer engineering at
the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about math and coding, and I often
stay up way past my bedtime working on my latest project. When I'm not in front
of a computer, I love to read, spend time with animals and friends, listen to
music, and play video games. I also enjoy playing jazz, classical, and rock
guitar.
