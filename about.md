![Here I am!](/assets/me_small.png)

Hello! I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Datadog](http://datadoghq.com/). I
recently completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the
University of Waterloo. I've previously completed internships at Flipp (formerly
known as Wishabi), Datadog, Disqus, Busbud, and 500px.

I'm interested in using distributed systems to solve problems in software
systems related to scalability, maintainability, and performance. My previous
internships have focused on designing and building scalable server-side software
systems, as well as managing monitoring, configuration management, and
deployment & automation for these systems.

In the past, along with my development and operations responsibilities, I’ve
also had experience managing projects, designing product, providing customer
support, consulting clients, and training junior team members.

I also love to write! Several of my technical writings have been published on
The New Stack (http://thenewstack.io/author/elijah-andrews/) and the Datadog
blog (http://datadoghq.com/author/elijah/).

Outside of work, I'm passionate about open source software. Lately I’ve been
dabbling into 2D and 3D game development. I also enjoy music, and love to play
guitar.
