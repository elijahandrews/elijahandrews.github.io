Two days ago, I [blogged about](/blog/neat-ice-formations/)
waking up to a foggy winter morning, and the neat ice formations that existed as
a result. However, one thing I didn't show was a picture of the fog itself --
the reason being that my mind was more focused on making coffee than
taking photographs. This morning, though, I woke up and the fog was there again!
He's a picture:
