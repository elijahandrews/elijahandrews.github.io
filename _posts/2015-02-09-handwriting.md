This is my handwriting:

I've come to realize that my regular handwriting differs from the handwriting
that I use when I'm doing math. When using certain letters as variables or
symbols in a mathematical context, I write them in a completely different manner
than how I write them in sentences. Interestingly (or at least interestingly to
me) I can remember precisely why I write these letters differently when they're in
equations. The course of actions that leads to this is always as follows:

1. I learn a new area of mathematics in which I'm required to use a new set of
variables.
2. I write the variable using my normal handwriting.
3. I realize that using my current handwriting, I'm unable to differentiate
between two distinct symbols. As a result, the math becomes very difficult.
4. I force myself to adopt a new way to write one of the characters that allows
me to distinguish between the two.

The first time this happened was when I began to take physics in high
school. The began by covering kinematics, and I was
introduced to four lovely linear motion equations:

$$ v_{f} = v_{i} + at $$

$$ d = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$

$$ v_{f}^2 = v_{i}^2 + 2ad $$

$$ d = \frac{v_{f} + v_{i}}{2}t $$

For those unfamiliar with these equations, they describe an object's motion
through a single dimension as a function of time.  $$ t $$ is the amount of time
that has elapsed, $$ v_{i} $$ is the initial speed, $$ v_{f} $$ is the final
speed, $$ d $$ is the object's displacement, and $$ a $$ is a constant
acceleration experienced by that object.

I used to write $$ t $$ as follows:

Hastily written, the $$ t $$ looks very much like an addition sign. This was never a
problem, as up to this point I simply avoided using $$ t $$ as a variable when doing
math. Unfortunately, in my new physics class, this was no longer viable.

For a while, I continued to write $$ t $$ as I had previously done. I distinctly
remember a quiz where I got so jumbled up between my addition signs and my time
variable that I erased my entire solution to start fresh, only to have the quiz
period end immediately after doing so.

Displeased with my glorious quiz grade of 0%, I started writing $$ t $$ with a
little tail at the bottom, which easily differentiated it from an addition sign.
Since then, I've always written $$ t $$ in this manner when doing mathematics:

Peculiarly, I still omit the tail when I'm not doing math.
