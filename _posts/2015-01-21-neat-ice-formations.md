The other day, like any other school day, I woke up at 7:15 am. However,
I noticed something different: it was foggy outside. Well, that part isn't the
interesting part. The interesting part was that it was foggy outside in the
*dead of winter*. I don't think I've ever seen fog in the winter, let alone
when it's about -20°C outside.

By the time I left my apartment — around 8 am — the fog had dissipated. However,
I noticed that it had left neat ice formations on some of the trees. Here are a
few hastily shot photos I took on my walk to class:
